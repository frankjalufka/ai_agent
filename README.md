AI Agent Project
****************

This is a project based on the guidelines from boot.dev on developing an AI Agent.

This project utilizes Google's Gemini API to build a very simple version of Claude Code. This Agent is able to accept a coding task, choose from a set of predefined functions to work on the task such as:

- Scan files in a directory
- Read a file's contents
- Overwrite a file's contents
- Execute the Python interpreter on a file

This is a CLI tool used to practice and gain experience writing a multi-directory Python project.
